# It's a Beautiful Day on Mars

Our brief this assignment was to develop a full dynamic front end web application using an API. Having never used an API before I wanted something simple to parse, so weather data seemed like a good starting point. NASA also has a robust collection of public APIs, so I chose to create a website for the InSight Mars lander to report it's data collection!

## Wireframe

I used Figma to create a sketch of the website with placeholder copy. The fact that I didn't fine tune the spacing at this stage meant that I lost a lot of time in the code. During the poster project, the meticulous measurements really paid of when I got to coding. Rushing this step meant that I was tweaking the spacing between sections for a long time afterward.

## Code

The first step was creating all the div elements and getting them aligned. This step was slower than I had wanted, and I spent a lot of time reading about the different type of flex elements.
